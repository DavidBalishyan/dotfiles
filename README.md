All of my config files in one github repo
# Neovim
1. Used [AstroNvim](https://github.com/AstroNvim/AstroNvim.git) as a starting point
2. Used [AstroCommunity](https://github.com/AstroNvim/astrocommunity.git) for community-driven plugins and language servers
3. For starting template see "nvim/README.md"
**Note: ** I don't use this neovim config anymore, check out my new config [**here**](https://github.com/DavidBalishyan/LazyVim)
